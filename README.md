## Inspiration

This project is inspired by a publicly stated engineering focus:

> "Exposed real-time market data, order-room negotiation and reputation over WebSocket + gRPC"

It rebuilds the *core primitives* behind that kind of system — topic fan-out,
backpressure, and reconnect control — as a small, zero-dependency TypeScript
library.

## What it implements

- **`src/bus.ts` — `EventBus`**: in-process publish/subscribe with wildcard
  topic patterns (`market.*` matches `market.btc`; `**` matches zero or more
  segments, so `market.**` matches `market`, `market.btc` and
  `market.btc.trades`; a bare `*` or `**` matches every topic). `publish()` fans out to all matching subscribers and returns how
  many accepted the message. Each subscriber gets an independent bounded
  queue; delivery is batched on a microtask so slow consumers exert real
  backpressure instead of blocking publishers. `publishBatch(messages)` fans
  out a whole batch and schedules a single flush for it — N messages cost one
  event-loop round instead of N — with identical matching, drop, and
  backpressure semantics, returning the total accepted deliveries.
  `subscribe()` accepts an
  `onBackpressure` callback that fires — once per excursion, re-armed after the
  queue drains — when a subscriber's queue reaches its 80% high-water mark,
  reporting queue size, capacity, and the cumulative `droppedCount`.
- **`src/backpressure.ts` — `BoundedQueue<T>`**: fixed-capacity FIFO queue
  with `drop-oldest` / `drop-newest` policies, a drop counter, and a
  high-water-mark callback that fires once at 80% capacity and re-arms after
  the queue recedes. `push(item, priority = 0)` is priority-aware: under
  `drop-oldest` the oldest lowest-priority entry is shed first, so
  high-priority messages are dropped last; an incoming item that is strictly
  lower priority than the whole backlog is discarded instead of evicting it.
  `droppedByPriority` exposes per-priority drop counts.
- **`src/reconnect.ts` — `ReconnectController`**: connection state machine
  (`idle → connecting → connected → backoff → connecting …`) with an
  injectable `BackoffStrategy` (`ReconnectOptions.strategy`). The default is
  `ExponentialBackoff` (exponential backoff plus jitter with a configurable
  delay cap and injectable randomness for deterministic tests); pass a custom
  strategy for fixed, linear or decorrelated-jitter policies — it takes
  precedence over the legacy `baseDelayMs`/`maxDelayMs`/`jitterMs` options.
  Supports `onGiveUp` after `maxAttempts` failures. The connect function is
  injectable for testing.
- **`src/heartbeat.ts` — `HeartbeatMonitor`**: keep-alive for a
  `ReconnectController`. While the controller reports `connected`, it sends a
  ping every `intervalMs` through an injected `pingFn` (resolved on pong);
  a pong that does not arrive within `timeoutMs` counts as a missed
  heartbeat — `onTimeout(missed)` fires and the connection is handed back to
  the reconnect state machine via `controller.notifyDisconnected()`, driving
  the normal backoff/reconnect flow. Pings are skipped whenever the
  controller is not `connected`, an in-flight ping blocks the next tick so a
  hung peer cannot stack pings, and `onPong(latencyMs)` reports each
  round-trip.

## Run

Requires Node.js ≥ 22 (uses native TypeScript type stripping — no build step,
no dependencies).

```bash
npm test
```

## Test

`npm test` runs `node --test test/`. Coverage includes:

- `test/bus.test.ts` — exact, single-segment (`*`) and multi-level (`**`)
  wildcard delivery, non-matching topics, fan-out counts, unsubscribe,
  queue-full drop semantics, the per-subscriber `onBackpressure` callback
  (one-shot high-water-mark firing, re-arm after drain, dropped-count
  reporting), and `publishBatch` (single-flush batch fan-out, per-message
  ordering, both drop policies, empty-batch no-op).
- `test/backpressure.test.ts` — both drop policies, one-shot high-water-mark
  behavior, drain ordering.
- `test/reconnect.test.ts` — exponentially increasing backoff delays within
  the jitter window, give-up after `maxAttempts`, attempt-counter reset on
  successful connect, the disconnect → backoff transition, plus custom
  strategy injection: a fixed-delay strategy is honored verbatim (taking
  precedence over the legacy numeric knobs), a linear strategy receives
  1-based attempt numbers, and the default exponential backoff grows/caps
  deterministically with injected randomness.
- `test/heartbeat.test.ts` — successful pongs report latency and keep the
  connection up, a hung peer times out exactly once and hands the connection
  back to reconnect (no stacked pings), pings stay silent while the
  controller is not connected, consecutive timeouts grow the miss counter
  until a pong resets it, and `stop()` halts the interval.
